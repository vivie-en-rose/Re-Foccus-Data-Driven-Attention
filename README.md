# Re-Focus: Reverse-Engineering Social Media Algorithms
A data-driven project to mitigate "Brainrot" and reclaim cognitive control through algorithmic resistance.

## 📌 Project Overview
As social media platforms utilize Reinforcement Learning to maximize "Valued Watchtime," users often fall into a "Dopamine Feedback Loop." This project analyzes 1,000+ minutes of personal screen time to design a **Counter-Algorithm** that restores executive function.

## 📊 Data Insights
- **Peak Usage:** 700+ mins/day (during high-stress periods).
- **Core Triggers:** Facebook Reels & YouTube Shorts.
- **Focus Score Correlation:** Inverse relationship between "Red Time" (Short-form content) and Focus Levels.

## ⚙️ The Counter-Algorithm (Logic Flow)
I implemented a personal protocol based on "Cognitive Taxes":
1. **The 5-Reels Rule:** Every 5 reels must be followed by 2 mathematical problems.
2. **Circuit Breaker:** Automatic system lock after 60 mins of low-priority usage.
3. **Focus Redirection:** Process monitoring to reroute from entertainment back to learning apps.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Data Collection:** Manual logging & Screen Time API.
- **Analysis:** Excel (Quantitative analysis).
- **Logic Design:** Mermaid.js / Flowchart logic.
